    "In this assignment, you will first complete a number of small exercises about each chapter to make sure you are familiar with the most important concepts. In the second part of the assignment, you will apply your newly acquired skills to write your very own text processing program (ASSIGNMENT-3b) :-).

    "\n",
    "* Test your function using an example string, which will tell you whether it fulfills the requirements (remove punctuation, split, count). You will get a point for good testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b.) Create a python script \n",
    "\n",
    "Use your editor to create a Python script called **count_words.py**. Place the function definition of the **count** function in **count_words.py**. Also put a function call of the **count** function in this file to test it. Place your helper function definition, i.e., **preprocess**, in a separate script called **utils_3a.py**. Import your helper function **preprocess** into count_words.py. Test whether everything works as expected by calling the script count_words.py from the terminal.\n",
