    "Welcome to the course! In this course we will learn how to load, process and save data using a versatile programming language: Python. In this course we are going to practise Python using Notebooks. These Notebooks contain instructions and so called 'code blocks'. The instructions are paragraphs of text that explain the concepts we are going to use. The 'code blocks' contain Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are pretty straightforward. Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cells in a notebook contain code or text. If you run a cell, it will either run the code or render the text.\n",
    "* There are five ways to run a cell:\n",
    "    1. Click the 'play' button next to the 'stop' and 'refresh' button in the toolbar.\n",
    "    2. Alt + Enter runs the current cell and creates a new cell.\n",
    "    3. Ctrl + Enter runs the current cell without creating a new cell. (Cmd + Enter on a Mac.)\n",
    "    4. Shift + Enter runs the current cell and moves to the next one.\n",
    "    5. Use the menu and select Cell/Run all.\n",
    "* The instructions are written in Markdown. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice Markdown cheatsheet if you want to write some more.\n",
    "* Explore the menus for more options! You can even create a presentation using Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint when you're writing Python code: press Tab to auto-complete your variable names!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "* print information to your screen using the built-in function `print()`\n",
    "* assign *values* to *variables* (using valid and clear *variable names*)\n",
    "* understand the concept of *data types*\n",
    "* check and convert the type of an object\n",
    "* understand and work with two numeric types: *integers* and *floats*\n",
    "* do calculations in Python\n",
