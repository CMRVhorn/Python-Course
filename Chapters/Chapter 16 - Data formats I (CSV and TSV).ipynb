    "\n",
    "You probably have heard of (or are already quite familiar with) different data formats, such as plain text, tables (CSV/TSV), XML, JSON and RDF. These formats are simply the result of agreements that were made between people on how to organize and store data. Some of these formats, such as XML and RDF, have a high degree of structure, whereas plain text is a typical example of unstructured data. Structuring data according to predefined specifications allows information in the data to be easily ordered and processed by machines. You can compare highly structured data with a perfectly organized filing cabinet where everything is identified, labeled and easy to access. \n",

    "## 1. Introduction to CSV and TSV (tables)\n",
    "The **table** is probably one of the most common and intuitive data formats. Undoubtedly, you have already worked with tabular data in Excel, Numbers or Google Sheets. A table represents a set of data points as a series of rows, with a column for each of the data points' properties. In other words: a table has vertical **columns** (often identifiable by name) and horizontal **rows**, and the **cells** are the unit where a row and column intersect. Tabular data can be encoded as **CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values)**. CSV and TSV files are simply plain text files in which each line represents a row and the columns are separated by a comma (for CSV) or a tab character (for TSV)."
