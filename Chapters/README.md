# Chapters

This folder contains all the notebooks that we will use as our course material. It is divided into the following chapters:

- [Chapter 1](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Variables%20and%20Data%20Types.ipynb) starts with the very basics: you will learn about the simple but very useful built-in function `print()` and about assigning variable names to values. You will also learn what data types are, and we will start working with the numerical ones: integers and floats.

- In [Chapter 2](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%202%20-%20Strings.ipynb) we will dive into what may be the most important data type for programming in the Humanities and Social Sciences: strings. You will learn how to define and manipulate them, and you will understand them as sequences of characters. You will also be introduced to using string methods.

- [Chapter 3](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%203%20-%20Boolean%20Expressions%20and%20Conditions.ipynb) will teach you what Boolean expressions are and how to use them in if-statements. You will learn about indentation and nesting.
