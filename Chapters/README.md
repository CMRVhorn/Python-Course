# Chapters

This folder contains all the notebooks that we will use as our course material. For this course, we have divided the chapters into four blocks, each of which are closed off with an assignment:

- **`Block I`:** In this block, we will start with the very basics: you will learn about the simple but very useful built-in function `print()` and how to assign variable names to values. You will also learn what data types are, and we will start working with the numerical ones (integers and floats) and with strings. Finally, we will discuss boolean expressions and conditions (`if`-statements), where we will also introduce you to indentation and nesting.
