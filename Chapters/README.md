# Chapters

This folder contains all the notebooks that we will use as our course material. It is divided into the following chapters:

- [Chapter 1](./Chapter 1 - Getting Started with Variables and Data Types.ipynb) starts with the very basics: you will learn about the simple but very useful built-in function `print()` and about assigning variable names to values. You will also learn what data types are, and we will start working with the numerical ones: integers and floats.

- In [Chapter 2](./Chapter 2 - Strings.ipynb) we will dive into what may be the most important data type for programming in the Humanities and Social Sciences: strings. You will learn how to define and manipulate them, and you will understand them as sequences of characters. You will also be introduced to using string methods.
