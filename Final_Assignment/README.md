# Final assignment

For the final assignment, you are asked to:

1. process a number of files;
2. extract relevant statistics from those files;
3. present that information to the user (**create at least three visualizations**);
4. store the information in a useful format

There are two options: either you choose to carry out one of our proposals, or you propose an alternative project. We encourage you to discuss your ideas with us as soon as possible. Please do look at the proposals to get a sense of the scale expected of your project.

* [Proposal Forensics](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Final-Assignment/Forensics.md)
* [Proposal Linguistic Engineering - Patterns](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Final-Assignment/LE-patterns.md)
* [Proposal Linguistic Engineering - Statistics](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Final-Assignment/LE-statistics.md)

## Important dates

* **23-12-2016 13:00 pm**: decision about which direction you will choose. For those who will propose their own project, the project has to be approved by us before this deadline.
* **2-2-2017 23:59 pm**: 5-minute presentation (you will NOT receive a grade for this presentation ; see below for more information)
* **5-2-2017 23:59 pm**: deadline submission final assignment



## 5-minute presentation

You'll also have to present your work in the last session of the course. This is
useful for several reasons. 

* First, we want you to reflect on the way you've handled
your project. 
* Second, it's useful to see how other people tackle similar problems.
* Third, your fellow students' work may be useful to you in the future as well. We'd
like to encourage you to check out what your classmates did.

Also note that the presentation is three days before the final project is due. This means that there is some time to incorporate the feedback from your peers into the project.

## Preparation for the presentation

Here are some questions to help you reflect on your project. You don't need to
address all of these points in your presentation (5 minutes is *really* short!).
Just highlight the points that are most important for you.

* What did you do?
* Why is it useful?
* How did you do it?
    - What modules did you use? What are they useful for?
    - What kind of data did you use? How did you get it?
    - How did you manage your project? What did your workflow look like?
* How can others use or build on your project?
* What was the greatest challenge for you?
* What took the largest amount of time? (try to keep track of this)
* What would you do differently next time?

Note that these questions also serve to guide you through your project. Keep them in mind, and take notes as you progress. We also encourage you to discuss these points with your fellow students, even before the final presentation. In terms of format, you can choose any kind of presentation that you like (powerpoint, notebook, web demo, ...). 

## Grading

To score the final assignment, we will use [this grading form](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Final-Assignment/GradingForm.pdf). We will weigh our judgment criteria as follows:

|     |Weight|
|-----|------|
| Code Quality |40 |
| Statistics | 30 |
| Visualizations | 20 |
| Documentation | 10 |
