i am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.
see how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly.
i'm crying.

sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come.
corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody tuesday.
man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long.
i am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
i am the hippo, goo goo g'joob.

mister city policeman sitting
pretty little policemen in a row.
see how they fly like lucy in the sky, see how they run.
i'm crying, i'm crying.
i'm crying, i'm crying.

yellow mother custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye.
crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess,
boy, you been a naughty girl you let your knickers down.
i am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
i am the hippo, goo goo g'joob.

sitting in an english garden waiting for the sun.
if the sun don't come, you get a tan
from standing in the english rain.
i am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
i am the hippo, goo goo g'joob goo goo g'joob.

expert textpert choking smokers,
don't you think the joker laughs at you?
see how they smile like pigs in a sty,
see how they snied.
i'm crying.

semolina pilchard, climbing up the eiffel tower.
elementary penguin singing hari krishna.
man, you should have seen them kicking edgar allan poe.
i am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
i am the hippo, goo goo g'joob goo goo g'joob goo goo g'joob.
goo goo g'joob goo
