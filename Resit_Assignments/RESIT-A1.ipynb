The method is the following: for any pair of fractions $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$ you have to calculate the cross-product $a*d$ and $c*b$. If $a*d$ is bigger than $c*d$ then the first fraction is bigger; if the two products are the same then the fractions are equivalent; and if the second product is the bigger one then the second fraction is bigger.\n",
