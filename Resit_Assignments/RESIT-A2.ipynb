    "- Please store the two files in a folder called RESIT-A2_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME\n",
    "- Please zip your folder and please follow the following naming convention for the zip file: RESIT-A2_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.zip\n",
    "- Please submit your assignment on Canvas: Assignment 2\n",
    "- If you have **questions** about this topic, please contact us **(cltl.python.course@gmail.com)**. Questions and answers will be collected on Piazza, so please check if your question has already been answered first.\n",
